# These are the defaults from sass-lint with some small changes for sanity.
# People spend a lot of time fixing sass to conform to these rules. DO NOT
# have the arrogance to change them without asking the rest of the devs and
# having a really good argument as to why.

# When you change them, either
# convince your colleagues to back you up and support the change or
# be prepared to do make the changes to all the code yourself
# to keep the project compliant with these rules.
